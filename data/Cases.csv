Hello. I am experiencing a strange behavior of
NDSolve function when it is used with
Floor function in Mathematica 9.

I have attached a notebook containing a
minimum code that reproduces this problem.
When I removed Floor functions from the
equation, NDSolve allays returned the
same monotonously increasing function for
rns function as expected. But, with Floor functions,
NDSolve stochastically returned the all-0
function as its solution. I believe that
this behavior is not dependent on the
working environment because it was
reproduced in 2 different PCs
(both were Windows-based).

I hope this report is useful for improving
Mathematica.

I am trying to solve a first-order time-delay differential equation similar
to:


NDSolve[{y'[t]==-y[t]-ArcTan[Re[(y[t-1]+UnitStep[t-20] Sin[t])/0.2]],y[t /;
t<= 0]==1 },y,{t,-5,50}]

Plot[Evaluate[y[t] /. First[%]],{t,-5,50}, PlotRange->All]


I have used UnitStep[ ] to stop the Sin[ ] term from contributing until 20
seconds have elapsed.

Although Mathematica solves and plots the solution I get several error
messages.

I found that y[t] becomes complex when t>=20 and this generates many error
messages. I use the ""Re[ ]"" function to eliminate the (very small)
imaginary parts of y[t] and this does away with some of these messages. (I
don't understand why this should be necessary - it might have something to
do with the algorithm that Mathematica is using in the background.)

Have I done something wrong? The error messages are preventing me from
putting the NDSolve into a Manipulate[ ] ""wrapper"".

Any advice would be appreciated.

I admit I have some trouble understanding the proper use of Inactive/Formal
PDEs and NeumannValue to express Neumann's boundary conditions. I suggest to
expand the documentations and fix some typos (please see the referred SE
question).

 

What I want to report as an Issue however is the following. 

 

The following NDSolve gives a possible solution to the differential equation
-u''[x]==1 (whatever is the interpretation of Neumann boundary conditions,
in this case u'[1]==1):

 

NDSolveValue[{Activate@Inactivate[Div[-Grad[u[x],{x}],{x}],Div|Grad]==1+Neum
annValue[1,x==1],u[0]==0},u,{x,0,1},Method->""FiniteElement""]

 



 

The following identical NDSolve (but with Inactive equation) gives a
completely different result. Whatever is the interpretation of Neumann
boundary condition, the solution in no way can satisfy the differential
equation -u''[x]==1. It's a solution for u''[x]==1!

 

NDSolveValue[{Inactivate[Div[-Grad[u[x],{x}],{x}],Div|Grad]==1+NeumannValue[

Hi,

No notebook is attached as it is a general question.

I use NDSolve in a For loop where, for each successive iterations, I use different initial conditions.
Each successive iteration applies over a different interval of time.
All the intervals of time fit together as one long interval of time.
Therefore, I end up with a list of NDSolve solutions, each an InterpolatingFunction.
Each interpolatingFunction has the same structure, as seen in Sol01 and Sol02.
But note that they apply over different intervals of time.

How can I combine the solutions, say SolutionList = {s01,s02,s03} , to make one InterpolatingFunction for my entire problem?

I have many stages, so it is not practical to extract {x[t],y[t],z[t]} etc for each solution and then stitch them together with Piecewise.

I want to combine the solutions to apply over the large interval, in this case t=(0,150), and then extract {x[t],y[t],z[t]} etc from this meta-solution.

Sol01=

The computation of Fa, Fb etc. share many common and computationally

these ingredients for each equation at every step.  Is there syntactic

and this error message when I changed the value of Ho=0.8.




 

We resolved both the errors  by using the function Quiet to suppress the
error message as it didn't affect the computation. 
We compared both the codes by plotting the graph, one with the function
Quiet and one without. We manage to obtain exactly the same graph.
We would like to know on whether we have resolved the issue?

Hi,

I have a question with regard to NDSolve where I encounter some evaluation problems using Euler-Integration.

The issue concerns a pulse train which should integrate to +10 but for some reason I cannot see does not. Also I am surprised by the fact that the fixed step is not shown in StepDataPlot. The problem and the questions are explicitly documented in the notebook enclosed.

Hello,

NDSolve yields for the equation f''[x] + f[x] == 0 in the command

NDSolve[{
   f''[x] + f[x] == 0,
   DirichletCondition[{f[x] == 0.0}, x == 0.0],
   DirichletCondition[{f'[x] == 1}, x == 0.0]
}, {f}, {x, 0.0, Pi/20}, Method -> ""FiniteElement""]
Plot[f[x] /. %, {x, 0.0, Pi/20}, PlotRange -> All, PlotStyle -> {{Thick, Red}}]

only the trivial solution. The symbolic solution

DSolve[{f''[x] + f[x] == 0, f[0] == 0, f'[0] == 1}, f, x]

shows a sine. This example is a drastic simplification of a real finite element problem in which there will be probably no real choice of another 
integration method. There are mainly two questions:

- How can I get a non-trivial solution from NDSolve?
- If only one Dirichlet condition is given, how can I control which solution of a family of solutions is returned?

Thanks and kind regards     Stephan

Hi,

I would like to use the function NDSolveValue to solve Laplace equation in spherical coordinates. The Laplacian in spherical coordinates has singularity at the two poles, and NDSolveValue cannot handle it. How can I get around this problem?
The attached notebook has the code that I was using.

"2325720","509387c3-d866-386b-0fd0-54c18728d8ad","NDSolve error solving Stokes fluid flow with some names for dependent variables","I was trying variations of the Stokes flow example at http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-10/pdes-and-finite-elements/a-stokes-flow-in-a-channel.html, when I encountered odd behavior for NDSolve:
When I named the pressure variable 'p' instead of 'w' used in the WRI example, NDSolve gave an incorrect solution.
Simply substituting 'w' for 'p' in the equations fixed the problem. After trying several other variable names, it appears NDSolve works correctly only if the pressure variable name comes alphabetically after the velocity variable names.
The attached notebook has an example. I also see this behavior with other geometries.

At first, I thought I was making a mistake specifying boundary conditions or not understanding the use of Inactive operators.
While not relevant for the simple channel flow in the notebook, this led me to wonder which formulation of Stokes fluid flow equations NDSolve requires more generally. 
The WRI example uses the Laplacian form of the equation. But if I correctly understand the section ""Formal Partial Differential Equations"" in the documentation tutorial FEMDocumentation/tutorial/SolvingPDEwithFEM, the stress form seems necessary to specify stress boundary conditions.
Does NDSolve's interpret NeumannValue differently for these two (mathematically equivalent) forms of Stokes equations, as described in the attached notebook section ""interpetation of NeumannValue vs. form of equations""?
More generally, is there a way to query the NDSolve state to find exactly what left-hand side NDSolve uses for NeumannValue?
Thanks.

I am trying to solve something I would think is simple but seem to not find a solution.
It is a heat transfer on a finite thickness slab with heat flux boundary conditions, one side constant heating, the other adiabatic. When I change the heat flux nothing changes and I know it is not the solution either because there is an analytical solution.I would think my b.c. are correct. See my file.
Also, do you have examples with a similar problem but with heat flux at b.c. being convective or radiative.

Thanks, Nigel.  I heard back from customer service and they indicated they

enough time.  I've sent them a note back to that extent.



The startup is involved in designing heat sinks and spreaders for very high

This is 100% outside my role at SpaceX.

*URGENT*
Dear Sirs, 
I'd like to ask you how I can modify the precision and interpolation order of a NDSolve for partial differential equation. I've tried with the Options WorkingPrecision -> 10, InterpolationOrder -> 10, PrecisionGoal -> 3 but, by changing the numbers, the graphic is identical.
Thank you for your kind attention and all information you can give me.
Best,

My Mathematica License # is L2326-2054. I do have Premier Service.

I am using Mathematica 12.1.0.0. in my MacBook Pro with Mac OS 10.15.5.

The attached notebook, Some Numerical Kepler.nb, explains my question.  Basically I solve a system of ODE’s for some trajectory (orbit) and certain quantities are supposed to remain constant during the interval of time τ of the solution.  They do, but their plots look too “wiggly” (computer error?).  Is there a way to increase the precision?

 Any advice would be appreciated.  Thank you.

I have some code that uses NDSolve to solve a set of differential algebraic equations, using Method -&gt; {""EquationSimplification"" -&gt; ""Residual""}. However, I've recently started getting odd bugs with evaluating the Interpolatingfunction at the left endpoint, with the output being non-numeric (using List and Automatic inside a formula).

Attached is a stripped down example (which be stripped down further). Note that it works fine without the Method in this case (as it isn't a DAE).

I had a question from an Italian user about a message NDSolveValue::ivone
when solving a PDEs Boundary-value problem (see attached notebook).

Could you please let me know if NDSolveValue is able to solve such a kind of

As alternative to NDSolveValue, is there any other function able to solve
that system?

Message:
Upon changing from Mathematica 12.3.1 to 13.01, some NDSolve calculations slowed down 5x – 25x. Most ODE were 5-10x slower, but the time is insignificant. Using ExplicitRungeKutta with these ODE problems makes them go faster, suggesting the method selection algorithm has changed. Solving PDEs using the method of lines is 10x – 30x slower and can take a long time. I have attached a notebook with a PDE solution that is timed with Timing. Mathematica 12 takes 45 seconds (real time divided by 8 for 8 processors) and Mathematica 13 takes 1275 seconds (real time divided by 8 for 8 processors). At this time Mathematica 13 is not useful to me. Can someone tell me how to adjust the options? Thanks - Ken

Sometimes ago I solved the system of differential equations. In this 
time was Mathematica 8.0.4 (Win XP, 32-bit). Now I would like solve this 
system again in new Mathematica version 10.0.2 (Win 7, 64-bit), but I 
can't do it because evaluation is interrupted and it is shown Windows 
exception:

(Sorry - It is in Czech language but I hope that position of information 
is same as in English version)

I wish to solve an ODE using NDSolve. The ODE has the form y’(s) = f(y(s)) where f is related to an integral of y(s). I wish to approximate this integral using simple numerical quadrature, and therefore I need to know the step-size NDSolve is using at each step.

Hence I wish to input something like y’[s] == F[stepSize[s], y[s]] into NDSolve, where F is my approximation to f, and stepSize[s] is the current step-size being used by NDSolve.

I’ve searched “Advanced Numerical Differential Equation Solving in the Wolfram Language” and there appears to be many possibilities for achieving this. However, none of them appear straightforward.

Can you please suggest a simple way to achieve this?

Cheers,
Jason

I have a question from an Italian user and I don't know the answer. Could
you please help me?

--------

Using NDsolve, it seems that some adaptive algorithms(s) is (are) chosen
automatically. Only the number, say N,  of steps (or nodes) is required, and
no indication of the  stepsizes  is given. 

I assume that, given the interval on which one wants to solve a certain
ordinary differential equation, say long L, an  initial  stepsize is
computed as L/N, and then new values for  h  are computed  adaptively,
following some strategy. Is it so?
Thanks and best regards,

However, when I try NDSolve with Laplace's equation, it gives an error message about not evaluating to a numeric matrix. 
At first I thought this meant NDSolve could not handle equations with variable coefficients, but after reviewing the finite element tutorial, I found the problem instead arises from apparent singularities in the Laplacian in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. I say ""apparent"" because the symmetries mean the terms in the Laplacian with the singular coefficient actually have well-defined limiting values at those locations.
The attached notebook has examples and an attempted workaround by changing the Laplacian to avoid the singularities.
Is there a better approach to allowing NDSolve to exploit these common symmetries to reduce the dimensionality?

p.s., I came across this problem when trying to generalize the ""new in 10"" example of Stokes flow in a channel to flow in a pipe, using axial symmetry to reduce the 3D problem to 2D.

There is a peculiar behaviour of a notebook, and someone suggested to
forward it to support, because there could be a bug.



The code describes the diffusion through a cube, loosing material at 5 of 6
faces, one face being impermeable (flux = 0 ). The flux at an open face is
proportional to the concentration inside and the area of the face.

Everything is ok, the code runs on my system (I still have version 7,
running on Windows 7, 64 bit ,dual processor, 2.8 gHz)  in about 15 seconds,
and gives ""nice"" pictures as well. But when I change az to az = 6.
(describing a flat rectangular parallelepiped, and the final aim is az in
the order of 1 or even less ) I interrupted the evaluation after about 15
minutes.



The same things happens on a friend's latest version 12.2.0 (Linux x86 (64
bit)) and we are wondering what happens here.



I should mention that using the following option proposed by I don't know
whom and forwarded to me by Daniel Lichtblau speeds things up:



Method -&gt; {""MethodOfLines"", ""DifferentiateBoundaryConditions"" -&gt; False}

In the attachment youll find yet another working (at least under
Mathematica 7) NDSolve + IDA program to solve a large DAE system.

 

While Mathematica 7 solves the problem flawlessly within ~ 400 sec. every
newer Mathematica version fails either by just plain crashing or by just
sitting there for days doing (seemingly) nothing. I tried to tweak every
option (Pre/Acc goals, DAEInitialization, ImplicitSolver, etc.) this system
plainly just does not work ever since the ""EquationSimplification"" -&gt;
""Residual"" setting became necessary for the IDA solver to work at all. 

 

The persistence of this problem is making me move away from Mathematica and
Im also telling other users, that try to solve DAE systems, to do so and
switch to a combination of python+sympy-&gt;exprtk+SUNDIALS which allows better
control over the IDA solver albeit at a loss of simplicity. 

 

Best regards

Hi Katherine, 

I have Mathematica. I downloaded an example file (NDSolve with animated
chart) from WolframAlpha and it told me I needed to download the Wolfram CDF
player to view it. I assume it should have run in Mathematica without having
to download the player? For some reason it didn't recognize I had it.

Hello,

I saw that you recently downloaded Wolfram CDF Player. I assume you are
using it to view/interact with CDF files.

For your actual work, you'll want Mathematica to create your own custom
CDFs. I'd welcome knowing what specifically brought you to download CDF
Player. Have you considered using Mathematica for your work?

Best regards,

I am trying to solve something I would think is simple but seem to not find a solution.
It is a heat transfer on a finite thickness slab with heat flux boundary conditions, one side constant heating, the other adiabatic. When I change the heat flux nothing changes and I know it is not the solution either because there is an analytical solution.I would think my b.c. are correct. See my file.
Also, do you have examples with a similar problem but with heat flux at b.c. being convective or radiative.

I am experimenting with NDSolve and I would like to do the following, but I cannot work out from the documentation how to do it.

I have attached a notebook with the PDE I am trying to solve. I would like to solve this PDE in the following way.


*         I want to specify the k-Grid (spatial dimenstion, see notebook for example)

*         I also want to specify the t-Grid (time dimension, see notebook for example)

*         I want spatial derivatives to have DifferenceOrder 2

*         I want to use an Implicit Euler scheme in the time-dimension.

I am aware that this might not be the best or even a good method to solve this PDE, that there might be convergence problems etc., but that is not the issue at hand in this question.  I just want to solve this PDE with full control over the space and time discretization.

Many thanks for your help,

Jan Willemen.

Dear Wolfram Tech Support,

Why does the attached application of Mathematica’s NDSolve function works with one particular (constant) value of a driving function, but crashes when this value is increased by 25%?

I would expect a proper Mathematica function to return an error if its numerical calculations are not proceeding in an acceptable manner,  but not to crash your program.  The attached notebook therefore appears to demonstrate a bug in NDSolve.  I show this using the new version 11.1.1, but it also occurs for me using version 11.0.1.

"2214159","adb45073-8079-c4c9-1114-54b6b5f911cf","NDSolve with axial and spherical symmetry","Three-dimensional PDEs with axial or spherical symmetry can be much faster to solve numerically by using the symmetry to reduce the problem's dimensionality.
However, when I try NDSolve with Laplace's equation, it gives an error message about not evaluating to a numeric matrix. 
At first I thought this meant NDSolve could not handle equations with variable coefficients, but after reviewing the finite element tutorial, I found the problem instead arises from apparent singularities in the Laplacian in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. I say ""apparent"" because the symmetries mean the terms in the Laplacian with the singular coefficient actually have well-defined limiting values at those locations.
The attached notebook has examples and an attempted workaround by changing the Laplacian to avoid the singularities.
Is there a better approach to allowing NDSolve to exploit these common symmetries to reduce the dimensionality?

p.s., I came across this problem when trying to generalize the ""new in 10"" example of Stokes flow in a channel to flow in a pipe, using axial symmetry to reduce the 3D problem to 2D.

The attached notebook contains a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations.  The solution functions xi 0, xi 1, and xi 2 are probabilities that must add up to kappa = 1.  The solutions of the system represent geodesics in the probability space.  The geodesics deform for different values of alpha, which is set to zero at the moment.

NDSolve seems to encounter infinities at initialization.  One suggestion from Mathematica was to specify the initial conditions explicitly instead of allowing Mathematica to compute them.  I did, and now it complains that the order of the initial conditions exceeds the order of the differential-algebraic system.

Please take a look at the attached notebook.  Any help would be appreciated!

I need your help with the application of NDSolve. In particular, when I
apply NDSolve to the initial value problem

NDSolve[{y'[x]==x^2 + (y[x])^2 , y[0]==0}, y ,{x,0,3}]

Mathematica determines a singular point around x = 2.0.

How can I automatically extract this information? I tried using WhenEvent,
but failed.

Actually, I need to determine the set of points {x0, a} where NDSolve stops
by solving:
NDSolve[{y'[x]==x^2 + (y[x])^2 , y[0]==a}, y ,{x,0,3}]

So I know that x0 = 2.0 a = 0, but how to determine these pairs when -1 &lt;=
a &lt;= 1.

I'm using a Mac, OS 10.10.5
My license number is L2953-8453


In the attached notebook I'm solving for the thermal stresses in a pipe.

At the top level the basic procedure is as follows:

1 - Solve Laplace's equation for the temperature distribution in an irregularly-shaped region

2 - Substitute this thermal solution into the structural equations (with a slight radial displacement on the inner boundary as a boundary condition) for the radial and angular displacements throughout the region.

3 - Then solve these resulting equations using NDSolve and the (automatically-invoked FEM). It's here that NDSolve is giving me an error . . .


I'm getting error messages of the form

 ""Input value {-0.9703,-8.52282} lies outside the range of data in the interpolating function.""

But a quick plot shows that the points in question do in fact lie inside the region. So why am I getting this error message? How an I ""convince"" Mathematica that these points are not outside the region?

I inquired about what the default error on NDSolve was at the Wolfram
Mathematica info booth at the 2014 March American Physical Society
meeting and Jason told me to email support at Wolfram.
I am just wondering what the default error on NDSolve was.  I am
currently using Mathematica 9 student edition to numerically solve
some nonlinear differential equations and it gives great curves which
agree well with my simulations.  However I do not know the numerical
error of the curves that Mathematica gives me.  I would love to have a
plot where I directly compare the Mathematica curves to simulation
curves which include error bounds.  So I was wondering if it were
possible to get the error of the curve as a function of the curve
parameter.
My Activation Key if needed is 3157-0382-H6668W.

Ben Intoy

I recently installed Mathematica v10.3 and checked a project I was running
on few months ago under Mathematica v10.1.

This project solve a PDE with NDSolve and Finite Element Method over an
anulus region.

Under v10.1 and v10.2 the solution appear like this: 

  

Under v10.3 the solution appear like this: 

  

 

The source code is exactly the same. The ElementMesh is generated by myself
and has the same number of incidents and elements. I selected Pardiso as
linear solve method in both cases. Under v10.3 the solution process is
slightly faster even on slower pc and consume less memory.

I searched on the documentation if there are news v10.3 but I didn't find
anything that could explain this.

At present I'm unable to send a minimal working code to reproduce this. Any
chance to understand the reason of the changed behavior and eventually
restore the old?

 

What does changed on FEM between 10.2 and 10.3?

 

Thanks

Kindest Regards

There seems to be a bug in NDSolve.
The long input is a system of differential equations. The expressions for bund1[t] and bund2[t] depend on the event.
ev1[t] and ev2[t] tell us which is the valid expression for given t.
The first plot tells us that the 4 possibilities appear periodically.
The second plot tells us that near t=9.85 the relevant case is 1. This means that [cid:image002.png@01D4741B.AB434AC0]  and, therefore
[cid:image004.png@01D4741B.AB434AC0] = [cid:image006.png@01D4741B.AB434AC0]  .
However, in the last plot we see that this is not fulfilled.
What should I conclude?

I have a set of differential equations where the expressions on the right hand side are very complex. It is not easy putting them in. I can simplify the algebra by defining a set of auxiliary or intermediate variables. How can I define auxiliary variables within NDSolve?
 
As a simple example, I have a pair of differential equations:
 
x'(t)=-y(t)-x^3(t)
y'(t)=2x(t)-y^3(t)
x(0)=y(0)=1
 
I attach the Mathematica notebook which solves the differential equations. How can I create for example an auxiliary variable z(t)=-y(t)^3 and then use it on the right hand side for the expression for y'(t)?

Trying to use NDSolve using the method = ExplicitRungeKutta.

I need to have this singularity point appear as output

NOTE: My objective is actually to find a value of x &lt; 0.07855314..,

system with an initial condition at the value of x &lt; 0.07855314..,
which would then be able to be integrated through the singularity
of the first 5x5 system (using an IC which depends on the outputs for
y_i).

(I know my 1st 5x5 system is not stiff.)

Any help on how to proceed using NDSolve with ExplicitRungeKutta
